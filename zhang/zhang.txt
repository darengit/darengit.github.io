Min Zhang is an experienced commodities trader.

The biggest difference between the good traders and the great ones is that the great ones know
when to bet really big and when not to double down.

As a trader we will experience losing a lot of money in a short period of time. And it often
happens when you feel on top of the world.

The concensus view is usually right, until fundamentals (expected future fundamentals) start
turning and most have not realized it. (Technicals come in handy here)
