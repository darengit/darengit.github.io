Robert Greene is an author and historian who wrote books about realities in our world which
have exhibited themselves time and again throughout history. His books are very controversial.
Many view his books as teaching underhanded tactics that are manipulative and amoral.

From what I know of him, he himself is not a person that strictly employees the tactics taught
in his books. The books are not actually that well written, and contain bits and pieces which
are contradictory.

However I believe the subject area he is trying to cover is fascinating. The knowledge he is
passing onto others are good to know even if they are not employed. At least having knowledge
of these tactics will make people more aware when these tactics are being employed around them.
