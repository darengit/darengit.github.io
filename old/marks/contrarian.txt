contraianism is to be deployed when hurd like behavior drives investing masses in a wrong direction,
and that driving force is at a peak

2nd level thinking in my mind is very similar to contrarianism, its actually not useful most of the time
as the market is filled with a diverse field of thoughts, not all 1st level thinkers. but the time to employ
2nd level thinking is basically the same time that we should employ contrarianism, when the market as a whole
has gathered a large believe in a 1st level thought, and the popularity of that 1st level though is at a peak.

be patient
