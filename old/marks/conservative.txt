analytical errors
- failure to factor in full range of outcomes, including tail events

psychological errors
- succumbing to them
- failure to recognize a market drivens by a mass who have succumbed
- failure to capitalize on other's error at the right time

actively look for pitfalls to avoid them
enter at cheap enough prices to have as large a margin for error as possible

preparation, knowledge, anticipation of full range of outcomes help psychologically with trading decisions
