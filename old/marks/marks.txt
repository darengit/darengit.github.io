Howard Marks

Forecasts - are a logical and usually conservative extrapolation of current conditions. Ignoring
cycles and usually underestimating large abnormal forces.

The future is not able to be forecasted with enough accuracy. There is no way to accurately
predict the future action of every market participant. Technicals can come in handy.

The Market is full of diverse group of thinkers, but when a majority of the market are exhibiting
herd like mentality, 2nd level thinking (very much related to contrarianism) becomes very useful.

Most great investments begin in discomfort.

Hard to be right and not be affected emotionally by random forces.
