Trading is hard. Markets are extremely competitive. They are usually very close to efficient,
and most observed price movements are random. It is therefore exceedingly difficult to derive
a method that makes superior risk-adjusted profits, and it is even more difficult to successfully
apply such a method in actual trading. Last, it is essential to have a verifiable edge in the
marketsâ€”otherwise no consistent profits are possible.
