we are driven by pleasure and improvement. 4 chemicals in our brains are responsible for these
drivers, the one most responsible for improvement is dopamine.

The other three are endorphins, serotonin, oxytocin. They are mainly responsible for various
pleasures.

Dopamine can occur along with the other three. It drives our own goals.

We can keep motivated torwards a goal if our brain isn't saturated with dopamine from other
sources or a combination of the other pleasure chemicals.
