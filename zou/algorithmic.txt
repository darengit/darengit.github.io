Algorithmic trading is an incredibly competitive area. Successful algorithmic trading incurs
very little risk but is tough to scale. They typically execute trades that last anywhere from
seconds to hours but usually no longer than that.

The reason purely algorithmic trades don't have longer time horizon. A.I. has come a long way
but it is still not better than the best trained humans in a specific area. However computers
are faster. The longer a trade is held the smaller a computer's speed advantage gets.

Imagine a purely algorithmic strategy where trades have a longer holding period and doesn't
put on a massive number of trades. At this point if you employee an expert human trader to
monitor the output of the algorithm and overrules it when the human has strong conviction
that the algorithm isn't producing a profitable trade in this instance, you will have a system
that will beat the purely algorithmic strategy. This is only theoretical.

Some traders like to think of the entire market as their competitor. However when an algorithmic
strategy executes a quick trade, its typically picking off a few big buyers or sellers that
are sometimes unwillingly doing something slightly inefficient. And in that short time frame
the algorithmic strategy with its lightning speed is not competing with the entire market.
