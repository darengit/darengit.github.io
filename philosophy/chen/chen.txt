My friend Vincent Chen spent over 5 years as a management consultant where he gained
valuable exerience on what it takes to set yourself up for success in the corporate
world. He shared some of his main conclusions with me.

1. Work really hard initially. Give a first impression that you are a hard worker.
Display skill & will. Skill is probably something that increases slowly and something
to amass for the long run. However show your will to the best of your ability right
off the bat at a new work place. When you get off to the right start managers and
co-workers will be much more willing to give you the benefit of the doubt later on.

Two types of effort, visible effort and invisible effort. Visible effort is like
the amount of work you do, the amount of time you spend in the office. Invisible
effort is like practicing and rehearsing presentations, practicing so that you are
more refined in meetings, and being more prepared for every situation.

2. Being proactive. Take ownership, become a thought partner to your manager, make
their job easier by becoming more reliable. Earn their trust. Maybe prepare each Sunday
evening for the upcoming week. Be more thoughtful about everything work related.

Have more communication with managers and colleagues about work. When you are new
is a great opportunity to network.

3. Show people you want to learn and extend your expertise. Show them you want to
become better to contribute more to the team. You are trying to improve your skill
set to enable the team to do more. Show eagerness to learn. Take more responsibility.

Have a clear sense of how to grow in your role. Get superiors invested in your success.
Make yourself a personal mentee of your manager. Get them to help you help the team.
