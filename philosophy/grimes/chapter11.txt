It is not so much that the market is against us;
it is that the market sets us against ourselves.
every trading decision you will ever make is always made with insufficient information.
(the above causes anxiety)
The best we can do is to be aware of these biases and errors and to attempt to counteract them.
Perceiving Patterns in Randomness
We are pattern recognition machines. Our brains are so good at recognizing patterns that they
will readily create patterns where none exist.
Heuristics
Cognitive shortcut, very fast and efficient. wrong heuristics is bad.
Shifting Blame
Fight or Flight (happens for majority around VIX = 30)
Gamblerâ€™s Fallacy
Biases Concerning Losses
Overconfidence Bias
Confirmation Bias
Anchoring Bias
Recency Bias
Hindsight Bias
Illusion of Control
Random reinforcement is a profoundly powerful tool for behavior modification, and
is frequently used to train animals. If you train dogs and reward them every time they
obey, their good behavior will probably stop as soon as the rewards stop. On the other
hand, if you randomly reward their obedience by sometimes giving a treat and sometimes
not, the modifications to their behavior will usually be permanent. (Again, do
you see any parallels with slot machines?) It may be counterintuitive, but random reinforcement
is actually a much more powerful tool to shape behavior than consistent
reinforcement.
the pain of being wrong is greater than the pain of losing money.
Fear and Hope
Intuition, theory of mind (statistical?)
