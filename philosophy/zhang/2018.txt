Lessons from 2018 and resolutions from 11/6/2018 onward:
1.  Don't buy foreign stocks - who the fk knows the rules in those countries?  Investing is hard enough with good shareholder protection and the laws in this country.
2.  Don't buy single names.  Don't listen to anybody on single names - the smarter they sound the more damage they can do.  Stick to index benchmark weightings.  
3.  Don't use leverage  (max only 1-2% in anticipation of future cash flows).  Cash earns 3-4% (via NOT borrowing at rates+100-150 bps), that's an attractive risk-free return.  
4.  Don't sell b/c you don't need cash assuming cash flow positive (0% cash), only sell if you anticipate cash to meet future expenses.  
5.  Optimize tax losses by reallocating capital in Nov/Dec (consider taking losses, reallocate capital to other investments.
6.  Invest additional capital only into Vanguard index funds (VGT, VTI mostly).  VGT investment constrained by AAPL/MSFT weighting (no single name pretax notional > 8% of NW posttax ).  VTI when less capital constrained (other investments roll off).  Don't buy any index fund with expenses north of 15 bps.  Stick with Vanguard b/c they show track record of caring about shareholder and lower fees over time, easier to hold forever.  
7.  Don't buy any other investments, no matter how interesting it looks (Real Estate, Venture, Private Equity, Crypto etc. etc.).  You will get your face ripped off by scammers and fees, and it's INFERIOR risk-adjusted to index funds.  
8.  Waste less time thinking about the market and investing.  Spend more time on other crap.
